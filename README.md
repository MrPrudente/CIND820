This paper looks at effectively forecasting COVID-19 cases in Canada from 2019 to 2021 by using time series machine learning methods. This paper aims to answer the following three research questions: 1) Can COVID-19 cases in Canada be accurately forecasted with time series methods? 2) How do the COVID-19 cases in Ontario compare to other provinces? 3) Can time series forecasting be influenced with informative decisions? The first dataset contains number of tests, cases, deaths, and recoveries across Canada from 2020-01-31 to present while the second dataset contains demographic and geographic information of confirmed positive cases from Ontario (Interactive data visualizations of COVID-19 in Canada, 2020). The two datasets were published by the Public Health Agency of Canada and are publicly available on the Government of Canada website where they receive daily maintenance and updates (Confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in Ontario, 2020). The method used for this analysis is SARIMA which stands for Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. This will be used on the Canadian COVID-19 datset, specifically focusing on Canada as a whole.
